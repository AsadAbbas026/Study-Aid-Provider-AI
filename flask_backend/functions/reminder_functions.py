    Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. One of the fundamental areas within AI is Machine Learning, where algorithms enable computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on it. For example, supervised learning involves feeding labeled data into a model so it can learn to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. These concepts form the backbone of many real-world applications such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, and even autonomous vehicles. Before we continue further, just a quick reminder: your first quiz will be held this Friday, and it will cover topics from the introduction to AI up to the basics of supervised learning. Also, don't forget that Assignment 1 is due by Monday, so please manage your time accordingly. Now, moving on to unsupervised learning, which deals with data that has no labels...
